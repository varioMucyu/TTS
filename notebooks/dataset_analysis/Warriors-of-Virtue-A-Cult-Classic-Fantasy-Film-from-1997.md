Warriors of Virtue was directed by Ronny Yu, who later went on to direct Freddy vs. Jason and Bride of Chucky. The film features a mix of practical and digital effects, as well as impressive stunt work by the actors who played the kangaroos. The film also stars Angus Macfadyen as Komodo, Mario Yedidia as Ryan, and Marley Shelton as Elysia.
 
The film was released on May 2, 1997, and received mostly negative reviews from critics, who criticized its plot, dialogue, and acting. However, some praised its action sequences and its message of courage and friendship. The film was also a box office flop, grossing only $6.4 million against a budget of $35 million. Despite this, the film has developed a loyal fan base over the years, who appreciate its campy charm and nostalgic appeal.

Warriors of Virtue is not a masterpiece by any means, but it is a fun and entertaining film that will take you back to the 90s. If you are looking for a dose of nostalgia and fantasy, give it a try and join the warriors in their quest to save Tao.
  
Warriors of Virtue was followed by a series of five books by John Vornholt, which served as sequels to the film. Each book focused on one of the kangaroos and their respective virtues, as they faced different challenges in their homelands. Ryan, Chucky, and some of their friends also returned to Tao to help them along the way. The books were published between 1997 and 1998 by Boulevard Books.
 
In 2002, a film sequel titled Warriors of Virtue: The Return to Tao was released straight to DVD by Miramax Films. The sequel was directed by Michael Vickerman and starred Nathan Phillips as Ryan, Kevin Smith as Dogon, Nina Liu as Amythis, and Shedrack Anderson III as Chucky. The sequel was set many years after the first film, and featured a new villain named Dogon, who had taken over Tao from its young queen. Ryan and Chucky had to team up with a female warrior named Amythis to defeat Dogon and restore balance to Tao. The sequel did not feature the original kangaroo warriors, but instead had human-like warriors who represented different elements.
 
The sequel received even worse reviews than the original film, and was criticized for its low production values, poor acting, and lack of originality. The sequel also had a tragic behind-the-scenes story, as Kevin Smith, who played Dogon, died in an accident while visiting another film set in China. He fell from a prop tower and suffered severe head injuries that put him in a coma for 10 days before he passed away.
 
Warriors of Virtue and its sequel are not widely available on streaming platforms, but you can find them on DVD or online if you are curious about them. They are not for everyone, but they might appeal to some fans of fantasy and martial arts who are looking for something different and quirky.
